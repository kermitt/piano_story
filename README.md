## Piano_Story
Mapped piano notes to English letters to hear the 'music' of different sentences.  <p>
Text from the textarea will be converted into paino notes.<br>
Sadly, I forget where I got the mps from.<br>  

## Usage
Step1: Have a web server ( e.g., http://localhost:3030/piano.html )<br>
Step2: Type something into the textarea. <br>
Step3: Press the button. <br>
Step4: Listen. <br>

## Swing
There is a little random pause between playing different notes, to give a less robotic feel
